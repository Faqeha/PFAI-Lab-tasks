1. LangChain

LangChain is a framework for building applications with LLMs (Large Language Models).

It provides tools to connect LLMs with data sources, memory, and chains of logic.

Helps developers create applications like chatbots, question-answering systems, and agents with LLMs.

Example: Query a database using an LLM or connect a chatbot to external APIs.

2. LLMs (Large Language Models)

LLMs are deep learning models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like language.

They can perform tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, question-answering.

Examples: OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, LLaMA.

Core idea: Predict the next word in a sequence to generate coherent text.

3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG combines retrieval-based systems with generative models.

Steps:

Retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base.

Feed retrieved info to an LLM to generate answers.

Advantage: Provides accurate, context-aware responses without memorizing all information.

Example: Answering questions from company documents using a GPT model.

4. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

FAISS is a library for fast similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

Developed by Facebook AI to efficiently search high-dimensional vector embeddings.

Used in semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval.

Example: Finding top 10 most similar documents to a query embedding.

5. Vector

In this context, a vector is a numerical representation of data (usually text, images, or audio).

Text vectors (embeddings) capture semantic meaning.

Example: “cat” and “kitten” have vectors that are close in space.

6. VectorDB (Vector Database)

A VectorDB stores and indexes vectors (embeddings) for efficient similarity search.

It allows semantic search, nearest neighbor queries, and RAG pipelines.

Examples: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, FAISS-based DB.

Used to quickly find data points similar to a query embedding.

7. Generative AI (GenAI)

Generative AI refers to AI systems that create new content from data.

Can generate text, images, music, or code.

Examples: ChatGPT (text), DALL·E (images), Codex (code).

Core idea: Model learns patterns in data to produce novel outputs.

8. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

GANs are a type of generative AI that uses two neural networks in competition:

Generator: Creates fake data.

Discriminator: Tries to distinguish real vs fake data.

Through this adversarial process, GANs learn to generate realistic data.

Example: Generating realistic human faces, art, or videos.
